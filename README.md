- Automatic backup and restore

### Guidelines

## Security & Privacy

- **No external connections**: Extension works entirely offline

- **Local storage only**: All data stays in your browser
- **Minimal permissions**: Only requests necessary permissions

## Troubleshooting

### Extension not showing in toolbar
- Go to `chrome://extensions/` and ensure the extension is enabled
- Click the puzzle piece icon and pin the extension

### Paths not saving
- Check if Chrome sync is enabled in your browser settings
- Try refreshing the extension from `chrome://extensions/`

### URLs not opening correctly
- Ensure the current tab has a valid URL (not chrome:// pages)
- Check that your paths start with `/`

### Common Issues

**Q: The extension doesn't work on chrome:// pages**  
A: Chrome extensions cannot access internal Chrome pages for security reasons.

**Q: My paths disappeared**  
A: If Chrome sync is disabled, paths are stored locally. Enable sync or re-add paths.
